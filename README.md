This project is to develop a smart door lock using Arduino Uno that provides excellent security and quick access To Build this system we will be requiring the Hardware components Arduino Uno,16×2 LCD display, 4×4 Matrix Keypad, Servo Motor.

First we will simulate the design in Tinkler card online software Arduino.

This is how looks like when we design the circuit After Checking the software.
